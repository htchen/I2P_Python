# Week 7: Midterm Exam 1

**Exam Schedule:** Tuesday & Thursday (電腦教室考試)

---

## Exam Coverage

### Phase 1: Data & Coordinates (Weeks 1-3)
- Variables, Floats, Tuples
- Functions and the Math module
- Haversine Formula implementation
- Lists, `for` loops, `range`, `zip`
- Dictionaries and nested structures
- JSON reading/writing

### Phase 2: APIs & Network (Weeks 4-6)
- HTTP Request/Response cycle
- Status codes (200, 403, 404, 429)
- User-Agent headers and API etiquette
- Nominatim API for geocoding
- Error handling (`try/except`)
- Generators and `yield`

---

## What to Review

1. **Haversine Formula** — Be able to implement from scratch
2. **JSON Parsing** — Extract data from nested structures
3. **API Calls** — Construct proper requests with headers
4. **Error Handling** — Handle common exceptions gracefully
5. **Generators** — Understand `yield` vs `return`

---

## Sample Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Haversine
Write a function that takes two coordinate tuples and returns the distance in kilometers.

### Problem 2: JSON Navigation
Given a nested JSON response from Nominatim, extract the latitude, longitude, and display name.

### Problem 3: Error Handling
Write code that gracefully handles network timeouts and invalid responses.

### Problem 4: Generator
Create a generator that yields coordinates from a list, one at a time.

## Exam Format

- Computer-based exam in the lab
- You may use Python documentation
- No internet access during the exam
- Two attempts available — higher score counts

## 筆試 (Written Exam - 5%)

The written exam is held together with the midterm. It covers:
- Conceptual understanding of APIs
- HTTP protocol basics
- Algorithm complexity (basic)
- Code reading and tracing
